# String-Sorting-Agorithm
This algorithm sorts string by converting it into integer. Very efficient if a fixed number of characters are  used in each string.
Does conversion by converting each string into a unique number. This is achieved by assuming a unique base for conversion which is equal to number of unique characters used in strings.
